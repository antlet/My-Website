My name is Tommy Antle and I am a junior at Allegheny College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. Software engineering and data analytics are two fields that I am interested in. I enjoy working with software in Python, Java, C and R. I also have a deep love for cars, so I would love to enter a field that incorporated cars and tech together.
