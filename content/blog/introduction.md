The research area that peaks my interest the most is static Python code analysis. Throughout my entire computer science learning experience I have used static code analyzers to perform lint checks, format checks, etc. I did not fully understand the way that analysis was performed or why it was necessary until working with the area for quite some time. Reflecting on what I have learned, I now know that analyzing static code is extremely beneficial to ensure accuracy and efficiency among other things involving source code. Beyond that, things like analyzing code complexity, looking for metrics and extracting data all fall under the topic of static code analysis and all have their need. I am especially interested in this area and plan to pursue it with research because of my most recent Python project. This project took Python source code, located various instances of specified things (statements, constructs, etc.) and counted those instances. I enjoyed working on this project, and since it dealt with a form of static code analysis I decided to pursue the area as a whole. I chose Python versus any other language and versus programming languages as a whole because it is the language I am most proficient in and enjoy the most. If I discover through my research that static code analysis on programming languages as a whole is better suited to me, then I will make the switch.
